# Goals
Provide an integrated solution for classical virtualization users based on OKD, HCO, and KubeVirt, including a graphical user interface and deployed using bare metal suited method.

# Projects

* OKD - as the platform
* KubeVirt - as the virtualization plugin
* HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO) - for supporting tools
* Rook? (Or whatever the upstream operator is called) for feature rich data storage
* Medik8s and NHC for high-availability
* Konveyor for migration from other platforms

# Deployment

* UPI first
* Assisted Installer? for easy provisioning of OKD on bare-metal nodes

# Mailing List & Slack

OKD Workgroup Google Group: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/okd-wg>

Slack Channel: <https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/openshift-dev>

# Announcements


# TODO

* some social activity like a blog post and more upstream documentation

* just as a general comment (I don't have "real" data), I want to add that on CI side we are more flaky on OKD than on OCP: nothing so serious, but we see more false positives on OKD lanes than on OCP ones
